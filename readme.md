# Mega Textures

This is a little experiment to do mega textures. This is meant to be a simple implimentation only.


## What Are Mega Textures

What I mean by mega textures is what existed in Quake Wars, not what was in Rage (Virtual Textures). Its also called dynamic mip mapping.



## Code

All the code surrounding the mega texture itself is in the `code/` directory. `external/` directory are helpers, mainly surrounding SDL use and math etc.


## How It Works (Brifely)


## More Information


## Included Projects

I've only included an xcode project, however rebuilding for Windows should be easy enough. There is nothing OSX specific. You'll just need to get the Windows SDL2 lib, and GLEW or something.


## Licence

Everything inside the `code/` directory is public. The rest is covered by their individual repos/projects.
