# Mega Textures

This is a little experiment to do mega textures.


## What Are Mega Textures

What I mean by mega textures is what existed in Quake Wars, not what was in Rage (Virtual Textures). Its also called dynamic mip mapping.


## Code

All the code surrounding the mega texture itself is in the `code/` directory. `external/` directory are helpers, mainly surrounding SDL use and math etc.
